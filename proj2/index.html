    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p>In this project we first implemented bezier curves and surfaces, one of the geometry bedrocks of computer
      graphics. Then we used half-edge data structure to represent mesh grid. Next is edge flip and edge split, which is
      the basic operation for loop subdivision. Finally we implemented loop subdivision, a technique that smoothen the
      mesh grid.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>

    <p>
      De Casteljau's algorithm is a recursive approach to use linear interpolation to evaluate points on a Bezier curve.
      In our implementation, we called lerp function on every neighboring pair of control points, making the total
      number of control points to decrease by one. With this fundamental evaluateStep function, we called it repeatedly
      until there is only one control point. Such a point is what we expected to be on the curve.
    </p>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>

    <p>
      De Casteljau's algorithm can be extend to a 2D patch circumstance. We first used the 1D evaluateStep function to
      evaluate every row of the n by n control points grid with a fixed linear interpolation parameter of u. After above
      step, we would get a set of points which are located on the original row bezier curves respectively. We view this
      group of points as new control points. Finally, we perform de Casteljau's algorithm on these new control points
      with a linear interpolation parameter of v. In this dynamic process of altering u and v, the set of possible final
      point locations is the patch, or 2D Bezier surface we want.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 3: Average normals for half-edge meshes</h3>

    <p>
      To calculate the area weighted normal vector at a given vertex, we have to loop through all the neighboring faces
      and calculate their area and normal vectors. This divide the problem into two subparts:
    </p>

    <p>
      First, we need to loop through the faces (and their vertices). To do so, we use the twin iterator defined in every
      half-edge. We notice that current->twin->next is the next starting half-edge of a new face. Therefore, we can use
      a do-while loop to iterate through all the faces adjacent to the given vertex v.
    </p>

    <p>
      Second, we need to calculate the area of the face triangle at a given starting half-edge.
      We use the half-edge that originates from the given vertex and call next three times to get three half-edges in a
      counter-clockwise fashion. Then, the three vertices we want is just the source points of these three half-edges.
      Once we have the coordinates of three source points, we calculate the cross product of the two vectors they form.
      The outer product's length is the area of the parallelogram, which is proportional to the area of the face
      triangle. Thus, we can simply accumulate these cross products and normalize them in the last step.
    </p>

    </div>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 4: Half-edge flip</h3>

    <p>
      To flip an edge of two triangles, we use local variables to store all half-edges, vertices, and faces involved in
      order to have a clear picture of what we are going to modify. During the process, we first delete two half-edges
      and one edge. After deletion, we add two new half-edges and one edge, and then totally reorgranize the pointers in
      these mesh elements to get the two side-by-side new triangles.
    </p>

    <div align="middle">
      <table style="width=100%">
        <tr>
          <td>

          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>

    <p>
      Funny thing during the debugging: Since we used a fully commadline-based build and debug workflow with cmake on
      MacOS, we chose to use "lldb" as our debug tool. The problem was we naturally thought "lldb" was just an apple
      version of "gdb" with exact the same command set but it turned out "lldb" use different commands in its subset.
      That caused a lot of trouble because we kept typing in gdb commands and getting errors.
    </p>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 5: Half-edge split</h3>

    <p>
      First, we new one vertex, two triangles and three edges. We asssign the position of the new vertex to the midpoint
      of the original edge.
      We basically follow this order:
      1. For each vertex, edge, and face, set its halfedge pointer;
      2. For each half-edge, set its next, twin, vertex, edge, and face pointer to the correct element.
      After implementing this, we met a strange problem. If we split this particular edge (after splitting once), the
      face adjacent to one of the edges on the upper triangle we split gets deleted.
      And after using lldb and check_for() function, we found we fail to correctly assign the new faces to those
      unmodified edges.
      Sometimes you only notice those new edges but fail to change those quite invisible edges. It's wise to set
      everything from the start.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>

    <p>
      To implement loop subdivision algorithm. The first thing is to make sure one wrote a COMPLETELY correct edge flip
      and edge split algorithm in part 4 and 5. This is the first lession we've learned during task 6. Once edge flip
      and edge split is correct, we perform the three-step implementation as described in the guideline. 1.A We loop
      through all the old vertices and compute their new position in their newPosition fields. 1.B We loop through all
      the old edges and compute their new position in their newPosition fields using 1/8, 1/8, 3/8, 3/8 weights. 2.
      Split all the edges in our mesh then flip only those edges connection a new vertex and an old vertex. 3. We loop
      through all vertices, if it is new we set its position to its edge's newPosition. If it is old we set its position
      to its own newPosition.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another key point in during implementing loop subdivision is the decision on which edge to flip. We found that
      simply flipping edges connecting a new vertex and an old vertex would not work since there are new-old vertex
      edges along the old edges but we don't need to flip these ones. To handle this problem, we took advantage of the
      isNew field in vertex and edges. We set the splited vertex's isNew field to true and two newly created edges'
      isNew field to true. With that, we derived the condition "(vertexA->isNew XOR vertexB->isNew) AND edge->isNew" to
      be the one that helps us decide which edge to flip during the flipping stage.
    </p>

    <p>
      What happens to sharp corners and edges? The sharp corners and edges are not averaged as their flat partners.
      Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges? We tried as below, now our subdivided cube becomes a
      smooth regular tetrahedron it is symmetric and beautiful.
