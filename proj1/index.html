    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p>In this project we've built a rasterization pipeline for simple triangle. On the basis of triangle, we can render
      a variety of other shapes defined in our SVG input.
      In task 1, we built a simple rasterizer for triangle.
      In task 2, we added supersampling, an anti-aliasing technique for rasterization.
      In task 3, we performed layered transform on a robot SVG.
      In task 4, we implemented a barycentric interpolation algorithm which can be used in either color or later uv
      coordinates.
      In task 5, we implemented pixel sampling on textures, including nearest and bilinear sampling.
      In task 6, we implemented level sampling on mipmap.
    </p>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Drawing single-color triangles</h3>

    <!--
Walk through how you rasterize triangles in your own words.
Explain how your algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle.
Show a png screenshot of basic/test4.svg with the default viewing parameters and with the pixel inspector centered on an interesting part of the scene.
Extra credit: Explain any special optimizations you did beyond simple bounding box triangle rasterization, 
with a timing comparison table (we suggest using the c++ clock() function around the svg.draw() command in DrawRend::redraw() 
to compare millisecond timings with your various optimizations off and on).
-->

    <p>
      We use min and max function to compute the left, right, up, and down bounding lines of given triangle.
      This saves us from iterating every pixel in the screen space. Therefore, our algorithm is no worse than one that
      checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle.
      To find out which side of the line segment does the point lie, 
      we can simply substitute the point in the equation of the line segment. 
      For example for the line formed by (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), the query point (xp,yp) can be substituted like:
      <code>result = (yp - y1) * (x2 -x1) - (xp - x1) * (y2 - y1)</code>. We check the relative position between the query point and 
      three line segments composed by three vertexes of the triangle, and when query point all lies on the same side of line segment, it is inside the triangle.

    <p>
      As you can see, one interesting point of the vanilla triangle rasterization algorithm is that there is severe
      aliasing on certain tip of our triangle.
    </p>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>

    <!--
Walk through your supersampling algorithm and data structures. 
Why is supersampling useful? 
What modifications did you make to the rasterization pipeline in the process? 
Explain how you used supersampling to antialias your triangles.
Show png screenshots of basic/test4.svg with the default viewing parameters and sample rates 1, 4, and 16 to compare them side-by-side. 
Position the pixel inspector over an area that showcases the effect dramatically; for example, a very skinny triangle corner. 
Explain why these results are observed.
Extra credit: If you implemented alternative antialiasing methods, describe them and include comparison pictures demonstrating the difference between your method and grid-based supersampling.
-->
<p>
  Supersampling is a method of antialiasing that attempts to reduce jagged, pixelated edges (aliasing) in images. 
  It works by sampling a higher resolution version of the image to get the average color of a pixel before reducing it to the intended size. 
  The averaged color values create smoother transitions along an edge of colors, reducing the jagged look.
  <p>
  For each pixel, we divide many small strides, check whether each small pixel is inside the triangle and then add color of each super sampled pixel (# super sampled pixels = pixels * sample_rate) into our sample buffer. Then we get the average color of a pixel
  and add it into the framebuffer.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 3: Transforms</h3>

    <!--
  Create an updated version of svg/transforms/robot.svg with cubeman doing something more interesting, 
  like waving or running. Feel free to change his colors or proportions to suit your creativity. 
  Save your svg file as my_robot.svg in your docs/ directory and show a png screenshot of your rendered drawing in your write-up. 
  Explain what you were trying to do with cubeman in words.
-->
<p>
  We try to make a dancing robot by rotating the arm and leg of our robot. First in the svg file, you need 
  to distinguish which part is arm or leg and then add rotate parameter for the corresponding part. In order to
  make its waving arm more naturally, I shift up the arm a bit by changing the "dy" in translation parameter.

    <h2 align="middle">Section II: Sampling</h2>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>

<!--
Explain barycentric coordinates in your own words and use an image to aid you in your explanation. 
One idea is to use a svg file that plots a single triangle with one red, one green, and one blue vertex, 
which should produce a smoothly blended color triangle.
Show a png screenshot of svg/basic/test7.svg with default viewing parameters and sample rate 1.
If you make any additional images with color gradients, include them.
-->
<p>
  Barycentric coordinates is that any point inside triangle can be interpreted as a liner combination of 
  the three vertices. The coefficient of each vertex can be considered as the mass of each sub triangle.
  In the following picture, <code>P=uA+vB+wC</code>,where A B and C are the vertices of a triangle 
  and u, v, and w (the barycentric coordinates), three real numbers (scalars) such that u+v+w=1 
  (barycentric coordinates are normalized). Only when 0 <= u,v,w <= 1, point is inside triangle.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>

    <!--
Explain pixel sampling in your own words and describe how you implemented it to perform texture mapping. 
Briefly discuss the two different pixel sampling methods, nearest and bilinear.
Check out the svg files in the svg/texmap/ directory. 
Use the pixel inspector to find a good example of where bilinear sampling clearly defeats nearest sampling. 
Show and compare four png screenshots using 
nearest sampling at 1 sample per pixel, nearest sampling at 16 samples per pixel, bilinear sampling at 1 sample per pixel, and bilinear sampling at 16 samples per pixel.
Comment on the relative differences. Discuss when there will be a large difference between the two methods and why.
-->

    <h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>

    <!--
Explain level sampling in your own words and describe how you implemented it for texture mapping.
You can now adjust your sampling technique by selecting pixel sampling, level sampling, or the number of samples per pixel. 
Describe the tradeoffs between speed, memory usage, and antialiasing power between the three various techniques.
Using a png file you find yourself, show us four versions of the image, 
using the combinations of L_ZERO and P_NEAREST, L_ZERO and P_LINEAR, L_NEAREST and P_NEAREST, as well as L_NEAREST and P_LINEAR.
To use your own png, make a copy of one of the existing svg files in svg/texmap/ (or create your own modelled after one of the provided svg files). 
Then, near the top of the file, change the texture filename to point to your own png. 
From there, you can run ./draw and pass in that svg file to render it and then save a screenshot of your results.
Note: Choose a png that showcases the different sampling effects well. 
You may also want to zoom in/out, use the pixel inspector, etc. to demonstrate the differences.
Extra credit: If you implemented any extra filtering methods, describe them and show comparisons between your results with the other above methods.
